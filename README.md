# trnql_interplay_ios
In order to make this app run as expected, you need to take the following steps:

1) Download the trnql iOS SDK from http://trnql.com/download_request/ and put the framework file in the same directory as the .xcodeproj file.

2) Sign up for a Google StreetMaps API key, which you can do by following the directions found here under the "API key" heading: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/streetview/intro

3) After you get the API key, go to the the TableViewController.swift file and put the API key in the 'googleAPIKey' variable.
